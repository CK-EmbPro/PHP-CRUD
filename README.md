This is about my crud-application-with php development

MY app is about simple things which are :
-Entering a new user 
-Getting all users saved in database using php and html  as the view template
-For the database that I have used is all about using "mysql"
-For other functionalities include like allowing the user of my app to change the desired user depending on the choice made through the table displaying all of the users 
-Other includes deleting a user specifically 


So I can say that all you want to review my codes you can reach PHP-CRUD folder in this repo and the review all codes related to CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete)
